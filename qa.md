# Q & A

## Is this the base/decided structure ?

## Whats the planned/desired pattern for hooks in micro-frontend apps ?

## Why dont we get all input data and prop drilling to whole app sub components ?

## How did the decision was made for hooks and which hooks to use ?

## Why only context based app ? What are the reason for context ? How does it help us ?

## Why to use useReducer instead of re-usable custom hooks ?
